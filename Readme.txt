npm install -g create-react-app

It is used to create react app. But it is like owing the whole application. And when it not in use then it will acquire a lot of space in our system.

npx install -g create-react-app

It is like  lending something for some time & return it back after the use of the app. So instead of using above statement we use this for better useability of the code. It also help to access all the element in our react app without using the space of our pc.

React is a library. But it is as good as framework.

>> npx create-react-app my-app

It will create a my app folder in which all the react library were installed

>> npx create-react-app .

It will download all the library in the accessed folder itself without creating new folder.
If the folder is not following the naming convention then it will some errors.

In src folder we have component for each part in our website.
